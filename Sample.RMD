## Introduction

This is a report on 2010 gun murder rates obtained from FBI reports. The original data was obtained from [this Wikipedia page].

We are going to use the following library:

```{r loading-libs, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
  
and load the data we already wrangled:

## Murder rate by state 

We note the large state to state variability by generating a barplot showing the murder rate by state:

```{r murder-rate-by-state, echo=F}
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb, rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity", color = "black") +
  coord_flip()
```
